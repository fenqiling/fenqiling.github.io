I'm a term lecturer and postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics.html) at Simon Fraser University, supervised by [Henny Yeung](https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics/people/faculty/yeung.html) and [Yue Wang](https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics/people/faculty/wang.html). I completed my PhD in Linguistics at the University of Florida, where I was advised by [Ratree Wayland](https://slam.lin.ufl.edu/people/ratree-wayland/). 

My research interests encompass a broad spectrum of topics within the field of linguistics, including speech production, speech perception, sound variation, speech emotion recognition, and bilingualism. By employing a diverse array of research methodologies including behavioral studies, neuroimaging, and computational techniques, my work seeks to deepen our understanding of these complex topics.

Presently, I am focused on investigating the expression and perception of [vocal emotions](/projects/1_project/) in different languages, striving to elucidate the complexities of emotional communication in speech. In addition, my work on sound variation in accented Mandarin explores [phonetic variation](/projects/3_project/) through the application of advanced [deep/machine learning models](/projects/2_project/).

Trained in linguistics, my research integrates linguistic theory with experimental and computational methods to examine the interplay between speech and cognitive processes. My work has been published in various [journals and conferences](/publications/).
