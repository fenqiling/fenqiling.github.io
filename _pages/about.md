I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics.html) at Simon Fraser University, supervised by Dr. [Henny Yeung](https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics/people/faculty/yeung.html) and Dr. [Yue Wang](https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics/people/faculty/wang.html). I completed my PhD in Linguistics at the University of Florida, where I was advised by Dr. [Ratree Wayland](https://slam.lin.ufl.edu/people/ratree-wayland/). 

My general research interests lie in speech production, speech perception, sound variation, speech emotion recognition, and bilingualism. In my studies, I have used a variety of research methods, including behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational techniques. 

Iâ€™m currently investigating the [vocal emotions](/projects/1_project/) in American English and Mandarin Chinese, aiming to unravel the complexities of the expression and perception of emotions in speech. In addition, I am interested in [sound variation](/projects/3_project/) in accented Mandarin and am exploring the use of [deep/machine learning models](/projects/2_project/) to analyze the phonetic variation of certain sounds in accented Mandarin.

Trained as a linguist, I combine linguistic theories with experimental and computational methods to study speech and the brain. My work has been published in various [journals and conferences](/publications/).
