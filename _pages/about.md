I am a Research Fellow in Neurology Artificial Intelligence at Mayo Clinic, where I collaborate with [Dr. Hugo Botha](https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/botha-hugo-m-b-ch-b/bio-20452613) to apply deep learning models for monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, particularly frontotemporal dementia, through remote voice recordings.

Before joining Mayo Clinic, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Linguistics at Simon Fraser University. I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Florida, where I was mentored by [Dr. Ratree Wayland](https://slam.lin.ufl.edu/people/ratree-wayland/).

My research spans speech production and perception, computational modeling, and using speech as biomarkers. Alongside my work in neurodegenerative diseases, I explore the expression and perception of [vocal emotions](/projects/1_project/) across different languages, aiming to enhance our understanding of emotional communication. I also investigate [phonetic variation](/projects/3_project/) in accented Mandarin through advanced deep/machine learning models.

With expertise in both speech sciences and computational methods, my research focuses on uncovering patterns and variations in speech to address real-world challenges, including emotional speech processing and health-related applications. My work has been published in various [journals and conferences](/publications/).
