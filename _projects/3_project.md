I am particularly interested in the sound variation of the lateral and retroflex fricative sounds in accented Mandarin, as native speakers of southern Chinese dialects may not produce these two sounds accurately in Mandarin. My research questions are as follows: (1) How would native dialectal background affect the phonetic variations of the two sounds in accented Mandarin? (2) What phonological factors may influence the phonetic realization of the sounds in accented Mandarin? 

To determine the acoustic features of the two sounds among speakers of accented Mandarin, a set of acoustic measurements were extracted from the production of Mandarin words beginning with the two sounds and then submitted to random forest classification. The accuracy of classification can be used to measure the relative similarity of these two sounds between different pairs of dialectal regions. The computation of conditional feature importance can shed light on the relative impact of acoustic measurements and phonological factors in predicting the two sounds in accented Mandarin.
