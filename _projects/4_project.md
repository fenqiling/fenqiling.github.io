I have been working as a graduate research assistant since 2021 for this [NSF project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2037266) led by Dr. [Ratree Wayland](https://slam.lin.ufl.edu/people/ratree-wayland/) and Dr. [Kevin Tang](https://www.kevintang.org/). For this project, we are trying to integrate deep learning models with articulatory and acoustic data to predict degrees of lenition in different types of speech, with an aim to provide a unique form of diagnostics medical and linguistic purposes. 

To measure the degree of lenition, we have trained a deep learning [Phonet](https://github.com/jcvasquezc/phonet) model to generate the posterior probabilities of sonorant and continuant features of Spanish stops in different contexts and compare them with previously reported matrics of lenition (e.g., Bro≈õ et al, 2021; Kingston, 2008).
