Although bilingualism has been associated with enhanced memory, attention, and executive function, there are many more qualities of bilingual speakers about which we are still unsure. I've been collaborating with Dr. [Huanhuan Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huanhuan-Liu-3) and her colleagues in China on a number of ERP and fMRI experiments to learn more about bilingualism. Our joint projects have looked into issues including self-positivity bias in local and foreign language contexts (Liu et al., 2022), the impact of emotional conflicts on affective processing (Guo et al., 2022), and more. Our most current research on the neural networks underlying language and modal control in bilinguals has been published in the journal <i>Neuropsychologia</i>.
