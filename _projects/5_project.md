While bilingualism is commonly associated with enhancements in memory, attention, and executive functioning, there remain many attributes of bilingual speakers that are not yet fully understood. In collaboration with [Huanhuan Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huanhuan-Liu-3) and colleagues in China, I have been involved in a series of ERP and fMRI experiments aimed at expanding our understanding of bilingualism. Our collaborative efforts have explored various topics, including the self-positivity bias in both local and foreign language contexts ([Liu et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14145)), as well as the impact of emotional conflicts on affective processing ([Guo et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11571-022-09790-6)), among others. Our most recent research, which investigates the neural networks underlying language and modal control in bilinguals, has been published in the journal <i>Neuropsychologia</i>.
